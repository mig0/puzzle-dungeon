SwitchBox Puzzle

This puzzle is an extension of the Gate Puzzle and Barrel Puzzle,
introducing a new interaction between gates, plates, and barrels.
The maze contains plates that control the state of corresponding gates.
Each plate has a color, and pressing any plate of that color opens all
gates of the same color. Gates are initially closed, preventing access
to the finish.

Plates can be activated in two ways: the player stepping on them, or a
barrel being pushed onto them.

Barrels must be strategically placed on plates or pushed through open
gates to progress. If a barrel rests on a plate that controls a gate two
cells away (with a gap of one floor between them), the gate stays open
when the player pushes the barrel towards it. As long as the player or a
barrel remains on a plate or gate, the gate stays open. However, once the
player pushes the barrel away and no one remains on the plate or gate,
the gate closes again.

This dynamic interaction requires careful planning of movements,
positioning of barrels, and plate activations to clear the path to the
finish.

Goal: Open all gates using barrels and reach the finish.
