This video demonstrates both auto-generated and loaded Barrel Puzzle
(Sokoban) levels.

The first level, *original-1-modified.txt*, is solved in two stages: one
barrel manually, then using the return-first Greedy solver. Then the same
in reverse mode (after pressing *Alt-E*). During solution replay, the
speed can be adjusted using mouse wheel or *PgUp*/*PgDn* keys.

Next, a 5x5 Zero-Space Type B (ZSB) level is auto-generated and solved.
This is followed by more auto-generated levels: one with 5 barrels using
the old generation method, and another with 6 barrels using the new
method. After that, an auto-generated 4-room puzzle is shown. All these
levels are solved manually.

The video then shows a level featuring skeleton enemies, where Undo (*u*
or *z*) is used. This is followed by an auto-generated level with 7
barrels. An auto-generated level with 16 barrels was skipped by pressing
*n*. A subsequent 9-room level is played with a 1-minute time limit.

The final part of the video showcases four moderate levels from the
*Suitcase 01* collection. The first two levels (*AK-7* and *AK-10*) are
solved manually. In the third level (*Borella-1*), a solution is imported
from the clipboard using *Ctrl-S*. In the last level (*AK-1*), the map is
imported from the clipboard with *Ctrl-C* and, after some manual moves,
is solved optimally using the BFS algorithm.
