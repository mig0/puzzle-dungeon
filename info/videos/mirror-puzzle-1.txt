Mirror Puzzle is one of the most feature-rich puzzles. It supports
mirrors on barrels, carts, and lifts, as well as toggling gates, opening
locks, using portals, traps, and almost all other elements.

The goal is to deliver at least one beam segment from the generator to
the collector using mirrors. This video shows the solution of 12
different manually crafted levels. You can find these maps in the
*maps/mirror/* files.
