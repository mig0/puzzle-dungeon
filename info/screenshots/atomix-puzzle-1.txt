Title: Atomix generated bonus level
Puzzle: atomix
Theme: stoneage1

The atomix puzzle has a bonus mode where the goal is to push randomly
shuffled colored numbered balls to organize them in the right order
(rather than organizing the molecule atoms).

This shows a level with 4 rooms, each featuring 4x4 atomix bonus puzzle.

Also see the [partially solved screenshot](atomix-puzzle-2).
