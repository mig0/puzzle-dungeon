Title: Modified original Sokoban level 1 (Reverse mode)

The original levels by Thinking Rabbit for the first English version
of Sokoban, Soko-Ban were published by Spectrum Holobyte in 1988.
The original levels came from Thinking Rabbit's Sokoban (1982),
Sokoban2 (1984) and a few from SokobanMSX (1984).

This level was modified by authors of Puzzle Dungeon to be more compact,
suitable for the standard 13x13 size. However, here the barrels and
plates are swapped. And barrel pushes are replaced by barrel pulls.
This *reverse-barrel-mode* is achievable by pressing *Alt-E*.
