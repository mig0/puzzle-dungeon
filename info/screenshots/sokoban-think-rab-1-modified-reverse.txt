Puzzle: barrel
Theme: jewel
Title: Modified original Sokoban level 1

This level was modified by authors of Puzzle Dungeon to be more compact,
suitable for the standard 13x13 size. However, here the barrels and
plates are swapped. And barrel pushes are replaced by barrel pulls.
This *reverse-barrel-mode* is achievable by pressing *Alt-E*.
