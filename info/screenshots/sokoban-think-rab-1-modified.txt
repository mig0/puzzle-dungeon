Title: Modified original Sokoban level 1

The original levels by Thinking Rabbit for the first English version
of Sokoban, Soko-Ban were published by Spectrum Holobyte in 1988.
The original levels came from Thinking Rabbit's Sokoban (1982),
Sokoban2 (1984) and a few from SokobanMSX (1984).

This level was modified by authors of Puzzle Dungeon to be more compact,
suitable for the standard 13x13 size. The puzzle difficulty is similar to
the original. The Move-optimal and Push-optimal records are stored in the
sokoban map file itself using *Move-Record* and *Push-Record* headers.
