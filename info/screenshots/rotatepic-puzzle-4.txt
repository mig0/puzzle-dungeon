Title: Solved RotatePic puzzle 8x8
Puzzle: rotatepic
Theme: default

This variant uses the goal picture as the background of the whole level.
However not all 13x13 cells may be rotated. 11x11 cells may be navigated
as usual, and 8x8 cells contain the actual puzzle with rotate-able cells.

The solved state is shown. You may press KP Enter to achieve this.
Although this is considered a cheating.
